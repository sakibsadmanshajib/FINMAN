# FINMAN

An app developed to keep record of the income and expenditure of someone.

- The plan is to create an android app which will help keep record of all your transactions and give you a daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly report.

- Inspired by the Apple Card's App which gives you detailed view of where you've spend your money and when.

- It'll keep track of how much money a person have iun which account and they can make transactions from each account.

- Future plan is to add data-minig capabilties to seemlessly adding transactions without the interaction of the user from Mobile phone's SMS or user's email.

# Technologies used

- Django - python web framework

# Disclaimer

Well, I did test it, but I can tell there are so manny security holes, bugs. Extra points if you can make the backend better as well.

# How to Run this API

1. Install `python` and `virtualenv` on linux system or `anaconda` on your windows system.
2. Create an environment and install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Migrate using `python manage.py makemigrations backend` and `python manage.py migrate`
4. Create a superuser using `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
5. Run this command to start the server. `python manage.py runserver` adn the API will be available at http://localhost:8000/.
6. Get a token from http://localhost:8000/get-token/ by sending a POST request like this one.
    ```
    {
        "username": "your_superuser_username",
        "password": "your_superuser_password"
    }
    ```
7. For Authentication, use the token ain the Header
    ```
    Authorization: Token <user_token_collected_from_get-token>
    ```
